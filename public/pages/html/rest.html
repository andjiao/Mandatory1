    <h1 class="overskrift">REST API</h1>
    <span>

In most application we use the client-server architecture. 
the app itself is the client or the front end part.
undeer the hood, it need to talk to the server or the backend
to get or save the data.
This communications happens using the http protocol.
The same procotol that powers our app.

So on the server we expose a bunch of services
that are accesible via the http protocol. 
the client can then directly call these services by sending
http requests. Now this is where rest comes into the picture.

REST stands for representational state transfer

REST is a convention for building the http services.
So we use simple http protocol principles to provide support 
to create, read, update and delete data
We refer to these operation all together as CRUD operations.

    <h1 class="overskrift">Server-side rendering</h1>
        <span class="content">

            Whenever you visit a website, your browser makes a request to the server that contains the contents of the website. 
            Once the request is done processing, your browser gets back the fully rendered HTML and displays it on the screen. 
            If you then decide to visit a different page on the website, your browser will once again make another request for the new information. 
            This will occur each and every time you visit a page that your browser does not have a cached version of.

            It does not matter if the new page only has a few items that are different than the current page, 
            the browser will ask for the entire new page and will re-render everything from the ground up.

            What would actually happen would be that the entire new page would be rendered, and not just the new content.

        <h1 class="overskrift">Client-side rendering</h1>
        <span class="content">
            So instead of getting all of the content from the HTML document itself, you are getting a bare-bones HTML document with a JavaScript file
            that will render the rest of the site using the browser.
    
           The server is now only responsible for loading the bare minus of the website. The main boilerplate. 
           Everything else is handled by a client-side JavaScript library,
    
           If you were to load only the html without the Javascript, you will get a blank screen
           There is nothing to load from the html itself since the actual content needs to be rendered using JavaScript.
    
           You are rendering items with the browser, so it will instead use JavaScript to load the new content 
           and make sure that only the new content is rendered. Everything else will be left alone.
    
           This is much faster since you are only loading a very small section of the page to fetch the new content, instead of loading the entire page.
