        <span class="content">
            Node is a runtime enviroment for executing JS

            Before node we used JS only to build applcations that runs inside a browser. 
            
            So every browser has what we call a JS-engine that takes our JS-code and convert it to code that the computer can understand.
            In 2009 Ryan Dahl, the creator of node, thought it would be great to execute JS outisde of a browser. 
            So he took googles v8 engine, which is the fastes JS-engine and embeded it inside a c++ program and called that program node.

<h1 class="overskrift">Express</h1>

<span class="content">
Express is the most common framework for building web applications 
and web server on top of node.

It provides mechanisms to:

Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.

Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.

<h1 class="overskrift">NPM</h1>
<span class="content">
    NPM stands for node package manager
    it is a command line tool as well as a regristry of third part libraries
that we can add to our node applications.

so for pretty much any kind of functionality you want to add to your app, there is most 
likely a free, open source library or package or node module on the NPM regristry

on NPM theree is a bunch of building blocks on nPM, and all these are free and reusable code.

So you can easily add these building blocks to your application 

the way we add these node modules to our app is via a command line tool that is acalled npm or 
node package manager


NPM comes with node, when you install Node you also get npm, byt they are develpoped independetly
</span>

<h1 class="overskrift">Package.json</h1>
<span class="content">
    package.json is a json file that includes some basic information
about your application or you projects, such as it's name, it's version, it's 

it is a bunch of metadata about yout application. And all nodee applications by standard have
this package.sjon file.

to creeate a package.json file write in command line:

npm init --yes

before adding any node modules to your applcation, you need to create a pakcage.json file
